The attributes chosen, and their correlation with the principal components can be seen in the following figure.

Short passes and pass success are both positively correlated with the first principal component, 
where as defensive attributes such as tackles and fouls correlate more positively with the second
principal component.
The projected data across all 13 seasons between 2009 and 2022 can be seen in the following figure.

It is interesting to see that each season forms distinct
clusters, with the oldest season at the top and each successive season below
it. A lot of defensive attributes correlate positively with the second principal
component, and point towards the top left as seen in figure 5. That is also where most of the teams before 2013 are, showing us that teams were more
defensive back then relative to now, since each successive season has drifted
away towards the bottom right, the opposite direction.
Short passes and pass success both correlate positively with the first
principal component, and it is no surprise to see extremely successful teams
like Barcelona and Real Madrid far to the right of the rest of the teams.
Each season, they both form a distinct group, however, other teams can be seen gravitating towards them with each season, especially after 2016. This
could show the general style of football changing, from a more defensive to
aggressive style across this period of time.
