# Football-Analysis-using-PCA

Using data collected on football teams from the Premier League, La
Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga and Ligue 1, I have analysed how football has
transitioned in the last 13 years. The analysis was performed using machine
learning algorithms such as Principal component analysis and K-means. The
analysis is divided into different segments, focusing on a general analysis,
defensive performance, passing variation, and finishing ability. Teams in
general have shifted more towards a possession and passing approach rather
then crosses and long balls over the last 13 years.

Each league is also analysed separately to determine the nature of the
competitiveness and the variance in playing styles. The Bundesliga and
Ligue 1 were determined to be the least competitive. The La Liga had two
dominant teams across the decade exhibiting distinct playing styles. The
Serie A had the most competitive upper league table. The Premier League
has seen the rise of two new title contenders, almost imitating the La Liga
